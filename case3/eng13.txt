Pros of social networking are using social networks is the ability to instantly reach people from anywhere I think the best is real-time news and information discovery.If you want to know what's going on in the world, all you need to do is jump on social media.Cons of social networking are privacy issues and distraction and procrastination.people get distracted by all the social apps and news and messages they receive, leading to all sorts of problems.I think the worst is sedentary lifestyle habits and sleep disruption.This thing sometimes bothers me.
