In this era of rapid Internet development, our social interaction has gradually shifted to social networking.
We can easily and conveniently get in touch with others on the Internet. For example, Facebook, many people use it to find old classmates who have lost their connections for a long time.
However, correspondingly, the proliferation of network resources has caused our personal assets to be extremely insecure.
Therefore, I think the advantages of social networking sites are: convenience, speed, and shortening the spatial distance. The disadvantage is that there are too many false information and the data is easy to flow out.
The positive impact of social media on users is to make it easier for users to get the information they need to learn more. The negative effect is that we may get the wrong information, or as we saw in the movie, others can easily get our information, and even get private information such as account or passwords and make more use.
