
Nowadays,social media have brought us many conveniences ,it has become an important tool for us to share our life and emotion. But social media has also easily become a crime tool,like:lost our privacy ,disinformation... In my opinion,I think the government can guide people how to judge the truth of information and how to protect their privacy ,let people have more information about safe use social media.
