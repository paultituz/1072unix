This paper examines EEG signatures due to different color
stimuli. This problem has potential applications in examining
psychological response to color and in developping synthetic
artificial vision systems. Human response to color stimuli has
effect on human emotions, human reactions in color sensitive
activities such as games, driving, watching movies, etc. The
specific problem addressed in this study is whether EEG
signatures can be reliably used to discern colors. It is assumed
that this response is dependent on individuals and therefore the
goal is to discern colors based on EEG responses for one
individual and not across individuals of various ages, genders,
and mental states.
